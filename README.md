This site is created using Hugo, and deployed via GH Actions on GH Pages.
The .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml file holds the instructions for the GH Actions and deploy. 

You might run into token issues at some point, at which I suggest consulting these docs: https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-first-deployment-with-github_token

## Creating new posts
`hugo new blog/post-name.md`

## Testing 
`hugo server -D`
